              <p className="mb-4">
                A detailed inspection is the first step in winterizing your roof.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">What to Look For:</h3>

                <li>Sagging areas or structural issues</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Why It Matters:</h3>

                Identifying and addressing issues early can prevent costly repairs during winter when access to your roof may be limited.
